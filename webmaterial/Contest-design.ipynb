    "Here we use a simple example where contestants are risk averse with respect to prize money. Put differently, the expected utility of a contestant with cost parameter $c_i$ when exerting effort $x_i$ is $p_1(x_i) u(V_1)+p_2(x_i) u(V_2)-c_i x_i$ where $p_j(x_i)$ is the probability of winning $j$'th prize when exertin effort $x_i$ (given the equilibrium strategies of the other contestants) and $u$ is a strictly increasing and concave Bernoulli utility function. The contestant is risk averse with respect to prize money because $u$ is concave.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, the costs of effort are non-monetary and certain. The only uncertain part is which prize (if any) the contestant wins. (If the cost of effort was monetary, we would have to use the utility function $p_1(x_i) u(V_1-c_i x_i)+p_2(x_i) u(V_2-c_i x_i)$ which would complicate the analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model with non-monetary effort cost is relatively simple because the game of the contestants (for given prizes $V_1$ and $V_2$) is the same as in Moldovanu and Sella: Instead of $V_1$ we simply have to use $W_1=u(V_1)$ and instead of $V_2$ we use $W_2=u(V_2)$. The same analysis as in the paper gives the equilibrium strategies for the contestants $b(c) = A(c)W_1+B(c)W_2$ where $A(c)$ and $B(c)$ are as in the paper. The only small difference is in the designer's problem: The constraint that the total prize money equals 1 states $V_1+V_2=1$ which in terms of $W_j$ reads $u^{-1}(W_1)+u^{-1}(W_2)=1$. Hence, the constraint when optimizing over $W_1$ and $W_2$ is $W_2=u(1-u^{-1}(W_1))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below computes the optimal first and second prizes if cost parameters are iid uniformly distributed between 0.5 and 1 and there are 3 contestants. Here we get an interior solution: the first prize is $\\approx 2/3$ and the second prize $\\approx 1/3$. The intuition is that giving more prize money to the good types (via a higher first prize) does not give a lot of additional utility to them (because $u$ is concave, i.e. the marginal utility is decreasing). However, the marginal utility of the second prize is rather high (with the square root utility below it is actually infinite at 0) and can therefore motivate contestants (in particular those with medium and high cost parameters) considerably."
