#+Title: Mechanism Design 2016
#+Author: Christoph Schottmüller
#+Institute: University of Copenhagen, Department of Economics

* Announcements
- The *format of the resit* is the following: It is an oral exam with 15-20 minutes preparation time. You will get an example setting with several questions about it. In principle, all the questions could be solved by calculations but you will run out of time if you try to do this. The good news is that all the questions can be answered without calculation (though a bit of thinking might be required for some) if you know the material we covered in class.
- Several people asked about the page limit in the exam: Yes, it is actual pages (not counting the cover page). Remember two things: First, we just want to see how you got to your solution and that you know what you are doing (we don't need to see everything you ever calculated). Second, space eating calculations are mainly required in exercise 1 (there is hardly anything to calculate in 2 and 3).
- There will be a make up lecture on May 20 (regular time and place) as 2 lectures fell prey to holidays.
- Note that May 6 is NOT a holiday, i.e. there will be a lecture.
- There won't be a lecture on April 22 because of a public holiday.
- The internal evaluation results are posted below.

* Organization

The official course description (including schedule, exam requirements etc.) can be found [[http://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%C3%98kk08201u/2015-2016][here]].  A tentative lecture schedule is at the end of the page.

Lectures: Friday 12.00-15.00, CSS 2-1-12

If you have not taken Micro C (or forgotten most of it...), you might want to (re-)read chapters 1.1-1.3 and 3.1-3.2 in Robert Gibbons' "Game Theory" book before the course starts. You should also familiarize yourself with the maths [[https://github.com/schottmueller/mechdes/files/78397/math.pdf][handout]].

** Midterm
The midterm is a take home exam. You have to pass the midterm in order to be admitted to the final exam. The midterm should be done in groups of up to three people. Deadline is March 30 18:00. The exercises are [[https://github.com/schottmueller/mechdes/files/181807/midterm.pdf][available]]. [[https://github.com/schottmueller/mechdes/files/197540/Mechanism.DesignF16-web.xlsx][List]] of people who passed the midterm.

** Exam
The final exam is a take home exam. The date is May 21 at 10.00am to May 28 at 10.00am. You cannot work in groups in the final exam.

** Internal Evaluation
Thank you for participating in the internal evaluation. Here are the [[https://github.com/schottmueller/mechdes/files/212663/internal.evaluation.pdf][results]] (unfortunately in Danish only).

** Literature
The main text book for the first part is
- Mas-Colell, Andreu, Michael Dennis Whinston, and Jerry R. Green. Microeconomic theory. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. only chapter 23 

It is not absolutely necessary to buy the book (though it is a classic for serious micro theorists) and you might want to wait until after the first lecture. Another very interesting book (though with a slightly different approach) of which we will use a chapter or two is 
- Tilman Börgers. An Introduction to the Theory of Mechanism Design. Oxford University Press 2015 


We will also cover (parts of) a few papers. A tentative list of papers is the following (you have to use the on campus internet or connect via VPN in order to download the papers for free):
